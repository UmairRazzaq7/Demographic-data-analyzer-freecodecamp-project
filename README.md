# Demographic-data-analyzer-freecodecamp-project

This is my solution to the *Demographic Data Analyzer* project from FreeCodeCamp’s Data Analysis with Python certification.

In this project, I analyzed demographic data using *Python and Pandas* to extract meaningful statistics related to age, education, income, working hours, and countries.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal was to write a Python function that reads a CSV file and calculates various statistics based on the dataset. These include:

- Count of each race represented in the dataset
- Average age of men
- Percentage of people with a Bachelor's degree
- Income comparison based on education level
- Minimum working hours and the percentage of high earners among them
- Country with the highest percentage of people earning >50K
- Most common occupation among high earners in India

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Pandas*

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used was adult.data.csv, which contains information such as age, education, occupation, hours-per-week, salary, and more.

## 🚀 How I Did It

- Loaded the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Applied filtering and grouping techniques to extract insights
- Used functions like value_counts(), mean(), and conditional filtering
- Returned the calculated values in a structured format

## 📊 Outputs

The script outputs:

- Race distribution
- Average age of men
- Education level percentages
- Rich vs poor income comparisons
- Working hour insights
- Country-wise income stats
- Top occupation among Indian high earners

## ✅ Status

✔ Completed  
✔ Passed all required tests on FreeCodeCamp  
✔ Function returns all expected values accurately
